                  <AccordionContent>
                    Our AI uses advanced language models to create highly accurate summaries that capture 
                    the key points, main arguments, and important details from each video. The summaries 
                    are designed to give you the essential information without losing context.

                    ScribeSent works excellently with educational content, tutorials, news updates, tech reviews, 
                    and informational videos. While it can summarize entertainment content, it&apos;s most valuable 
                    for content where you need to quickly understand key insights and information.

                  <AccordionContent>
                    Summaries are typically generated and sent within 1-4 hours of a new video being uploaded. 
                    Processing time depends on video length and current system load. You can also choose to 
                    receive daily digest emails instead of individual summaries.
